NFL Draft History

Data for this project was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/nfl-draft-history-1990-present?resource=download).

# Goals of this project
The goal of this project is to analyze NFL Draft data from 1990-2022. 

Through the analysis of the data set, I will seek to provide answers to the following questions and goals:
* Create new data frames by separating the drafts by decade.
* Uncover which teams had the most top 10 picks over the years?
* Which positions have been chosen the most with the first 10 picks?
* How many 1st round & non-1st round players, by position, have made it to the HOF?
* Which colleges have had the most 1st round picks?
* Which colleges have the most players from select positions drafted rounds 1-3 over the years?
* Compare offensive vs. defensive draft statistics.
